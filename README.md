## Prisma Server

Your Prisma GraphQL database endpoint is live:

- HTTP:  https://us1.prisma.sh/emily-4cc201/prisma/dev
- WS:    wss://us1.prisma.sh/emily-4cc201/prisma/dev

### To start prisma server & the "playground"

- cd into `~/server
- run `yarn start`
- go to `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser, to open the GraphQL playground
- this interactive enviornment has built-in documentation (see right hand sidebar in browser)
